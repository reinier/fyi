# Repository Guidelines

This project is a small Eleventy site. Contributions should follow these rules:

## Coding style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (see `.editorconfig`).
- Use semicolons and ES module syntax (`import`/`export`).

## Tests and linting
- Run `npm test` after modifying any JavaScript or configuration code.
- Skip running tests when only documentation or comment changes are made.
- Currently there is no lint script defined. If one is added later, run it alongside the tests.

## Building
- Local builds can be produced with `npm run build`.
